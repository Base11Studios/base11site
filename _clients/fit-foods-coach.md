Fit Foods Coach is a meal plan assistant that can be used to help you meet your dietary goals. Get healthy and stay there! We do all the hard work - all you need to do is tell us what you were supposed to eat and how much, then we show you the best matches based on macro nutrient similarities (fat, protein, carb). Compare foods in the list and once you find the food you want to eat, we'll tell you exactly how much!

Using a calculator to compare foods can be time consuming and confusing - Fit Foods Coach does the work by comparing macros and showing you the best substitution. 

Any type of dietary plan you have, you can use Fit Foods Coach to help you. Use it to find post workout foods or ideas to stick to your meal plan.

Fit Foods Coach has all the staples of your diet and we'll be updating the food database regularly to give you better matches for what's on the menu or in your pantry. We have all types of food groups - vegetables, fruits, meats, beans, potatoes, whole grains, etc.

Most foods are measured in grams, but we keep it easy for things like bread and wraps and do it by the slice. We'll help you compare the weights of the different food options so you can choose to eat more or less based on your needs!
