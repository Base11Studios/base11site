## What is observing / mindfulness?

Mindfulness (or observing) is awareness of the present moment. It is living in the "now" and not thinking about the past or the future. In order to be mindful, sometimes it is helpful to close your eyes or focus on your breath. Your breath is always with you. You can always come back to your breath in life when you need help being more aware of the world around you.

Do you notice the birds chirping, the wind blowing against your face, the trees bristling, the warmth of the sun, the impact that a breath of fresh air can have on your mood? These are all lessons you will learn to notice and appreciate using Present Sense.

## Why focus on the present?

Have you ever found yourself ruminating in the past, replaying an event, or worrying about the future? A lot of times the thing we're worrying about never comes to pass or can't be changed and it was all worry for nothing. It happens to all of us, and usually doesn't result in us feeling at peace. By bringing our awareness to the present, something that is definitely happening, we can appreciate what we do have right now. Focusing on the present allows us to actually live our lives and enjoy the world around us.

## Why Mindful Journaling?

Have you ever tried to start up a mindfulness practice and had trouble creating a routine? Or are you consistently meditating but looking for more ways to bring mindfulness into your life? Mindful journaling helps us vocalize our feelings and notice the benefits of being present. By writing down how we feel after a mindful experience, we're creating a habit and training ourselves to pay attention in everyday life.

## How often should I do Mindful Experiences?

Everyday, all the time! As you focus on the present, your brain actually starts to change. If you actually bring your focus to each activity you do and pair it with deep breathing, you can change your perception of the activity and actually enjoy your time doing it. Think of every moment and every activity you do as a chance to practice mindfulness.
