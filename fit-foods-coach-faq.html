		<h3>WHY FIT FOODS COACH?</h3>
		<p>Fit Foods Coach uses nutrition information to find the top food substitution matches. We check macro values to make sure
			our recommendations are close to the original food. We'll give you a percentage match so you know how closely the foods
			match up.</p>

		<h3>WHY SHOULD I SUBSTITUTE?</h3>
		<p>If you're on a diet/meal plan that tracks calories or macro-nutrients like protein/fat/carbs, then we can help you stay
			on track! Our matches are based on nutritional amounts of calories, fats, proteins, and carbs. If you're eating a specific
			diet due to medical/doctor advice, consult them before attempting any substitutions provided by Fit Foods Coach.</p>

		<h3>WHAT DOES PWO STAND FOR?</h3>
		<p>PWO means "Post-Workout". It is important to consume the right nutrients right after your workout based on your diet plan.
			Depending on your goals, you can add in a PWO food that you might not regularly eat. PWO foods aren't good to choose as
			a substitution other than after a workout.</p>
